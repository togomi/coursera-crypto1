# 1. Introduction

## **Classical Cryptography**
- Relied exclusive on secret information (a key) shared between the communicating parties

### **Private Key Cryptography**
- a.k.a secret-key, shared-key, symmetric-key cryptography
    - ex) save encrypted contexts in personal laptop.
- A private-key encryption scheme is defined by a message space __M__ and algorithms (Gen, Enc, Dec):
    - Gen (Key-generation algorithm): generates _k_
    - Enc (Encryption algorithm algorithm): c <- Enc<sub>k</sub>(m)
        - takes key _k_ and message _m_ in __M__ as input
        - outputs ciphertext _c_
    - Dec (Decryption algorithm): m:=Dec<sub>k</sub>(c)
        - takes key k and ciphertext c as input
        - outputs m or "error"

- For all m in M and k output by Gen,</br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Dec<sub>k</sub>(Enc<sub>k</sub>(m)) = m

### **Historical Encryption Scheme**

#### Shift Ciphers
- Shift Cipher: shift every letter of the plantext by k positions
    - M = {strings over lowercase English Alphabet}
    - Gen: choose uniform _k_ in {0,...,25}
    - Enc<sub>k</sub>(m<sub>1</sub>...m<sub>t</sub>):= c<sub>1</sub>...c<sub>t</sub>, where c<sub>i</sub> := [m<sub>i</sub> + _k_ mod 26]
    - Dec<sub>k</sub>(c<sub>1</sub>...c<sub>t</sub>):= m<sub>1</sub>...m<sub>t</sub>, where m<sub>i</sub> := [c<sub>i</sub> - _k_ mod 26]

- Is it Secure?
    - No, because only 26 possible keys


#### Kerckhoffs's Principle
- Encryption scheme is not secret
    - The only secret is the key
    - The key must be chosen at random, kept secret

#### Sufficient Key Space Principle
- The __key space__ should be large enough to prevent "brute-force", exhaustive search attacks.
- But this does not guarantee secrecy.

#### Vigenere Cipher
- Key is now a string, not just a character
- Size of key space?
    - If keys are 14-character strings, the key space has size 26<sup>14</sup> ~ 2<sup>66</sup>
    - Brute-force search expensive/impossible

- Is it Secured?
    - No.
    - Attacking the Vengenere Cipher (a way)
        - Assume a 14-character key.
        - Observe that every 14<sup>th</sup> character is "encrypted" using the same shift.
        - Using plaintext letter frequencies
            - eg. e is the most commonly used letter in plaintext
        - Guess the first character of the key is (alpha - 'e') and repeat

#### "Variant" Vigenere Cipher
- Easier to work with ASCII plaintext and hex ciphertext.
    - The key is a string of bytes.
    - The plaintext is a string of ASCII characters.
- Easier to work with byte-wise XOR rather than modular addition.
    - To encrypt, XOR each character in plaintext with the next character of the key.
- Ex) Plaintext = "Hello!", key is 0xA1 2F
    - "Hello!" = 0x48 65 6C 6C 6F 21
    - key      = 0xA1 2F A1 2F A1 2F
    - cipher   = 0xE9 4A CD 43 CE 0E

- Attack: Time(Determine all bytes of the key) ~ 256<sup>2</sup>L, where L is the key length
    1. Determine the key length
        - Let p<sub>i</sub> (for 0<=i<=255) be the frequency of byte i in P.T.
            - ex) p<sub>97</sub> = frequency of 'a'
            - The distribution is far from uniform.
        - If the key length is N, every N<sup>th</sup> character of the P.T is encrypted using same "shift"
            - If take every N<sup>th</sup> character and calculate frequencies, we should get p<sub>i</sub>'s in permuted order
            - If take every M<sup>th</sup>(not multiple of N) character and calculate frequencies, we should get something close to uniform

        - Compute some candidate distribution sum(q<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup>). Try all possibilities for the key length, compute distribution and look for maximum value.
            - If close to uniform, ~1/256
            - If a permutation of p<sub>i</sub>, then much larger than 1/256

    2. Determine each byte of the key
        - Look at every N<sup>th</sup> character of C.T, starting with the i<sup>th</sup> character.
        - Try decrypting the stream using every possible byte value B.
            - If correct, a ll bytes in the P.T. will be between 32 and 127.
            - The frequencies of lowercase ltters should be close to knwon English-letter frequencies
                - Should find sum(p<sub>i</sub>q<sub>i</sub>) =~ sum (p<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup>) =~ 0.065
