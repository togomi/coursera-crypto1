#### Programming Assignment 1 (Maryland)
Write a program that allows you to "crack" ciphertexts generated using a Vigenere-like cipher, where byte-wise XOR is used instead of addition modulo 26.

This was generated by following C program:
``` C
#include <stdio.h>

#define KEY_LENGTH 2 // Can be anything from 1 to 13

int main()
{
  unsigned char ch;
  FILE *fpIn, *fpOut;
  int i;

  unsigned char key[KEY_LENGTH] = {0x00, 0x00};
  /* of course, I did not use the all-0s key to encrypt */

  fpIn = fopen("ptext.txt", "r");
  fpOut = fopen("ctext.txt", "w");

  i=0;
  while (fscanf(fpIn, "%c", &ch) != EOF)
  {
    /* avoid encrypting newline characters */
    /* In a "real-world" implementation of the Vigenere cipher,
      every ASCII character in the plaintext would be encrypted.
      However, I want to avoid encrypting newlines here because
      it makes recovering the plaintext slightly more difficult... */
    /* ...and my goal is not to create "production-quality" code =) */
    if (ch!='\n')
    {
        fprintf(fpOut, "%02X", ch ^ key[i % KEY_LENGTH]); // ^ is logical XOR
        i++;
    }
  }

  fclose(fpIn);
  fclose(fpOut);
  return;
}
```

(Of course, when encrypting I used a random key length and chose each byte of the key at random.) The plaintext contains upper- and lower-case letters, punctuation, and spaces, but no numbers.


### Output
```
$ gcc decrypt.c -o a.exe && ./a.exe
Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for, among other things, secure communication in the presence of attackers. Cryptography has been used for hundreds, if not thousands, of years, but traditional cryptosystems were designed and evaluated in a fairly ad hoc manner. For example, the Vigenere encryption scheme was thought to be secure for decades after it was invented, but we now know, and this exercise demonstrates, that it can be broken very easily.
