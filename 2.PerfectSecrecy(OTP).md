# Modern Cryptography

## **Core Principles**
Formal definitions, assumptions, proofs of security

### Formal Definitions
- Precise, mathematical model and definition of what security means.

### Assumption (of impossibility)
- With few exceptions, cryptography currently requires *computational assumptions*.
    - At least until we prove P != NP
- Any such assumptions should be made explicitly.

### Proof
- Provide a rigorous proof that a construction satisfies a given definition under certain specified assumptions.

## **Probability Review**
- Random Variable(r.v.): variable that takes on (discrete) values with certain probabilities.
- Probability Distribution for a r.v.: specifies the probabilities with which the variable takes on each possible value.

- Event(E): a particular occurrence in some experiment
    - P[E]

- Conditional Probability: probability that one event occurs, assuming some other event occurred
    - Pr[A|B] = Pr[A and B] / Pr[B]

- Two r.v.'s X and Y are independent if
    - Pr[X=x | Y=y] = Pr[X=x] for all x, y

- Law of Total Probability


## **Recall: Private Key Cryptography**
- a.k.a secret-key, shared-key, symmetric-key cryptography
    - ex) save encrypted contexts in personal laptop.
- A private-key encryption scheme is defined by a message space __M__ and algorithms (Gen, Enc, Dec):
    - Gen (Key-generation algorithm): generates _k_
    - Enc (Encryption algorithm algorithm): c <- Enc<sub>k</sub>(m)
        - takes key _k_ and message _m_ in __M__ as input
        - outputs ciphertext _c_
    - Dec (Decryption algorithm): m:=Dec<sub>k</sub>(c)
        - takes key k and ciphertext c as input
        - outputs m or "error"

- For all m in M and k output by Gen,</br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Dec<sub>k</sub>(Enc<sub>k</sub>(m)) = m

## **Perfect Secrecy**

### **Threat Model**
What capabilities the attacker is assumed to have
- Ciphertext-only Attack
- Known-plaintext Attack
- Chosen-plaintext Attack
- Chosen-ciphertext Attack

### **Security Guarantee**
What we want to prevent the attacker from doing.
> Regardless of *any prior* information the attacker has about the P.T., the C.T. should leak no *additional* information about the P.T.

### **Definition**
Encryption Scheme (Gen, Enc, Dec) with message space **M** and ciphertext space **C** is __*perfectly secret*__ if: </br>
&nbsp;for every distribution over **M**, every m in **M**, and every c in **C** with Pr[C=c]>0, it holds that
> Pr[M=m | C=c]  = Pr[M=m]

## **One-Time Pad**
The OTP is defined as follows.
- Let `M = C = {0, 1}^n` be the PT and CT spaces respectively
- Let `K = {0, 1}^n` be the key space, where the elements of K are random bit-strings in {0, 1}^n.

- Enc() and Dec() are defined as follows.
    ```
    E(k, m) = k XOR m
    D(k, c) = k XOR c
    ```

However is suffers from some problems, namely:
  - Symmetric: if Alice can send Bob a key, why can't she send him a message?
  - If we know the message and the ciphertext, retrieving the key is trivial

But is this secure?

* The idea is that the ciphertext should reveal no information about the plaintext.
```
    Definition (Shannon): A cipher `(E, D)` over `(K, M, C)` has perfect secrecy if, for all `a, b \in M` and for all `c \in C, Pr[E(k,a) = c] = Pr[E(k,b) = c]`, where `k` is uniform in `K`.

    i.e. given a cipher text, `c`, we have no clue which message it encodes. Picking the right message is as good as guessing at random.

    This implies that even the most powerful adversary learns nothing from the CT about the PT.
```
```
    Lemma: OTP has perfect secrecy.
```
```
    Proof: `Pr[E(k, m) = c] = (# of keys which map m -> c under E)/|K|`. Now `# of keys which map m -> c under E = 1` as we are XOR-ing.

    To prove this assume `E(k,m) = c = E(k', m)`, i.e. two keys map `m` to `c`.
    Then `k XOR m = c = k' XOR m`. XOR-ing both sides by `m`, we obtain `k = k'`.
    Thus, there is only one unique key mapping `m` to `c`.
    Therefore,

    ```
    Pr[E(k, m) = c] = 1/|K|, for all m.
    ```

    Therefore, OTP has perfect secrecy.
```

This implies that there is no CT only attack on OPT! However, it is NOT secure under other attacks.

Are there other ciphers with perfect secrecy which don't suffer from the flaws that the OTP does? Unfortunately, Shannon showed us that the OPT is in fact the optimal cipher w/ perfect secrecy.

Theorem (Shannon): A cipher `(E, D)` over `(K, M, C)` has perfect secrecy iff `|K| >= |M|`.

Any other cipher with perfect secrecy would need to have `|K| > |M|`, which means it would suffer from the same problems that OTP does.
